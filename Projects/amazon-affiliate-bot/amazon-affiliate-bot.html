        The Amazon Affiliate Bot was created using Node.js runtime and the npm package Puppeteer.
        When I became an affiliate for Amazon, I thought about automating the work I was doing, which
        involved going to the affiliate website, pulling product promotion details, then posting the promotions on a Facebook group.

        The bot is running on a Raspberry Pi between 6am and 12am, allowing me to earn passive income.
        The bot posts a deal every 3-4 minutes to prevent being flagged by Facebook for using a bot.
