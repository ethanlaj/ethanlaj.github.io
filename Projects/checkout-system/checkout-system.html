        The Checkout System is an ASP.NET Core Web App MVC using Entity Framework. 
        I was tasked with getting the initially broken system up and running 
        and adding more features that were requested by the client.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system is mainly ran on a touchscreen computer that has a 2D barcode 
        and prox ID card scanners connected to it. Each asset should have a 
        2D barcode attached to it that a user can scan to check it in/out.
